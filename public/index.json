After all, technical skills are visible, tangible, and measurable. But here’s the hard truth: technical skills alone won’t make you indispensable.\nThe landscape of data is changing fast. AI and automation are taking over repetitive analysis, report generation, and even advanced SQL tasks. If your value is limited to technical execution, your role is at risk.\nSo what really sets top-performing data professionals apart? It’s their ability to solve business problems.\n1. Understanding the Business Context # Data doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Every dataset, report, or model has a purpose: to influence decisions.\nA successful data analyst knows the why behind the numbers:\nWhat drives revenue or growth in the company? Which metrics truly reflect business performance? How do operational processes impact data quality? Without understanding the business, even the most advanced analysis can miss the mark.\n2. Connecting the Dots Across Teams # Data rarely lives in a single department. Marketing, sales, product, finance, and operations all generate data, and often it’s siloed.\nA strong data analyst:\nTalks to stakeholders across the organization Connects insights from different teams Translates complex data into actionable business recommendations It’s not just about finding correlations; it’s about seeing patterns that others can’t.\n3. Influencing Decisions # Numbers are powerful—but only if they lead to actions.\nData analysts need to:\nCommunicate findings clearly to non-technical stakeholders Present options, trade-offs, and recommendations Persuade teams to act on insights This requires empathy, storytelling, and a strategic mindset—skills that AI can’t easily replicate.\n4. Solving Problems That Matter # Not every problem deserves a data-driven solution. A valuable data analyst focuses on high-impact questions:\nWhich customer behaviors drive long-term retention? How can operational efficiency be improved without sacrificing quality? Which product features maximize revenue or user engagement? Mastering technical tools is the baseline. The real differentiator is business problem-solving ability.\n5. Learning How Businesses Really Work # To stay relevant, spend less time memorizing SQL tricks or mastering the latest BI tool, and more time learning:\nHow strategic decisions are made What levers drive business outcomes How different teams measure success This understanding turns you from a data technician into a trusted advisor.\nBottom Line # AI is coming for technical tasks—but it can’t replace business acumen, judgment, or the ability to solve real problems.\nIf you want to thrive as a data professional:\nStep out of the spreadsheet Talk to product and business teams Learn how your company really works Focus on solving problems that matter That’s the skillset that will make you indispensable—and future-proof your career.\n","date":"December 25, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/business-problems/","section":"Blog","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen you start your journey as a data analyst, it’s tempting to think that acing SQL queries, building complex dashboards, or mastering every new BI tool is the key to success.

Core Concepts # What is an LLM? # An LLM (Large Language Model) is a neural network trained on massive text corpora to predict the next token.\nWith enough scale, this simple objective unlocks:\nText generation Reasoning Translation Summarization Q\u0026amp;A By learning to predict the next word in sentences over billions of examples, LLMs implicitly learn grammar, facts, reasoning patterns, and even some world knowledge.\nTokenization # LLMs don’t read text — they read tokens.\nTokenization is how text becomes numeric input. Smaller tokens give flexibility but increase sequence length, while larger tokens are faster but less flexible.\nText → tokens → numbers Tokens can be words, subwords, or characters Example:\ncryptocurrency → crypto + currency Why it matters:\nHandles rare / new words Controls vocabulary size Impacts cost (more tokens = more compute) Context Window # The context window is the model’s working memory. LLMs can only “see” a limited number of tokens at a time. Anything beyond the window is ignored, so long documents may need special handling.\nMeasured in tokens (4k, 8k, 32k, 128k…) Bigger window = more context, better coherence Trade-off: cost \u0026amp; latency 2. Transformer Fundamentals # Attention (The Secret Sauce) # Attention lets the model decide what matters most in a sequence. It allows the model to focus on relevant words regardless of their position, enabling it to capture complex relationships in language.\nInstead of reading text left-to-right only, the model:\nLooks at all tokens Assigns importance weights Builds context dynamically This is why transformers scale so well.\nSelf-Attention Formula (High Level) # Self-attention computes a weighted sum of all words in a sequence, where weights measure relevance to each word.\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ / √dₖ) · V\nQ: What I’m looking for K: What I have V: The actual information Multi-Head Attention # Multi-head attention allows the model to capture multiple perspectives simultaneously, improving understanding of complex sentences.\nEach head focuses on different patterns: Syntax Semantics Long-range dependencies Positional Encoding # Attention alone has no sense of order. Positional encodings give the model information about word order.\nPositional encodings inject:\nToken position Sequence structure Without them, word order wouldn’t matter.\n3. Training Paradigms # Autoregressive vs Masked Models # Autoregressive (GPT-style)\nPredict next token Best for generation Masked (BERT-style)\nPredict hidden tokens Best for understanding \u0026amp; classification Autoregressive models excel at producing coherent text, while masked models excel at understanding context for tasks like classification or QA.\nPretraining Objectives # Next-token prediction Masked Language Modeling (MLM) Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) (less common now) These objectives define what the model learns during pretraining, shaping whether it is better at generating or understanding text.\nLoss Function # Cross-entropy loss measures how well the predicted probability distribution matches the true tokens. Lower loss = better predictions.\nMost LLMs optimize cross-entropy loss by:\nPenalizing wrong token predictions Encouraging probability mass on correct tokens 4. Generation Controls (Very Practical) # Temperature # Controls randomness:\n0.2 → deterministic 0.7–0.9 → balanced \u0026gt;1.0 → creative / risky Temperature scales the probability distribution of the next token. Low temperature = safe predictions, high = more diverse output.\nTop-K Sampling # Sample only from the top K tokens Prevents weird low-probability outputs Limits the choice to the most likely tokens, reducing nonsensical text while keeping some randomness. Top-P (Nucleus) Sampling # Sample from tokens whose cumulative probability ≥ p More adaptive than Top-K Dynamically chooses a subset of probable tokens so that rare but important words can still be selected. Best choice for creative tasks Beam Search # Beam search explores several paths at once, picking the most probable sequence, which improves fluency but reduces diversity.\nKeeps multiple candidate sequences Improves coherence Less creative, more “safe” 5. Fine-Tuning \u0026amp; Efficiency # Catastrophic Forgetting # When fine-tuning overwrites prior knowledge.\nMitigations:\nMix old + new data Freeze most weights Use adapters Without precautions, fine-tuning can erase the general knowledge learned during pretraining.\nPEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) # PEFT methods let you adapt huge models to new tasks without retraining everything, saving resources.\nPopular techniques:\nLoRA QLoRA (LoRA + quantization) Benefits:\nLower memory usage Cheaper training Works on large models with limited hardware Model Distillation # Train a small model to mimic a large one.\nDistillation transfers knowledge from a big model to a smaller one, keeping most capabilities but reducing compute needs.\nFaster Cheaper Great for edge devices 6. Retrieval \u0026amp; Reasoning # RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) # LLMs don’t “know” facts — they predict text.\nRAG pipeline:\nRetrieve documents Rank relevance Generate using retrieved context This:\nReduces hallucinations Improves factual accuracy By combining LLMs with external knowledge, RAG ensures outputs are grounded in real data rather than just model memorization.\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) # Encourages step-by-step reasoning.\nUseful for:\nMath Logic Multi-step questions CoT prompts make the model “think out loud,” improving multi-step reasoning performance.\nZero-Shot \u0026amp; Few-Shot Learning # Zero-shot: Just instructions Few-shot: Add 2–5 examples Prompt quality often matters more than model size.\nLLMs can perform tasks without explicit training, but giving examples usually boosts accuracy.\n7. Scaling Tricks # Mixture of Experts (MoE) # Many expert sub-models Only a few activate per input Result:\nMassive models Lower inference cost MoE allows enormous models to exist without making every computation expensive by activating only relevant “experts” for each input.\nAdaptive Softmax # It speeds up prediction for frequent words while using fewer resources for rare ones.\nOptimizes large vocabularies Faster training Lower memory usage 8. Challenges \u0026amp; Limitations # LLMs are powerful tools but come with technical, ethical, and operational challenges that must be managed.\nHigh compute cost Bias from training data Hallucinations Limited interpretability Privacy \u0026amp; data leakage risks Final Thoughts # This cheatsheet is not exhaustive, but it covers:\nHow LLMs work How they’re trained How to control them How to deploy them wisely Mastering these concepts is often enough to reason effectively about LLM behavior, limitations, and trade-offs in real systems.\n","date":"December 22, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/llm-notes/","section":"Blog","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLarge Language Models (LLMs) are everywhere now — chatbots, copilots, search, coding, writing, and reasoning.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is my \u003cstrong\u003epersonal LLM cheatsheet\u003c/strong\u003e: concise notes I use to refresh core concepts, training ideas, and practical techniques without diving back into papers or long courses.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"My LLM Cheatsheet: Concepts, Training, and Best Practices 🧠✨","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"December 22, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/rag/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"RAG","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"December 22, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/transformers/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Transformers","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"December 13, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/analytics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Analytics","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"December 13, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/audit/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Audit","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"December 13, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/benfords-law/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Benford's Law","type":"tags"},{"content":"When we talk about data fraud detection, most people think of complex models, AI pipelines, or forensic accounting teams armed with custom algorithms.\nBut sometimes, one of the most powerful tools is also one of the simplest.\nMeet Benford\u0026rsquo;s Law — a statistical phenomenon that shows up in countless natural datasets and can instantly reveal manipulation, fraud, or large-scale human error.\nAnd yet… very few analysts use it.\nThe Strange Pattern Hidden in Natural Numbers # Here\u0026rsquo;s a surprising fact:\nIn many real-world datasets, the leading digit \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; appears about 30% of the time.\nNot 10%.\nNot evenly distributed across 1 to 9.\nThirty percent.\nThis counter-intuitive pattern was observed as early as the 19th century and later formalized by physicist Frank Benford in 1938. He noticed that datasets — like river lengths, electricity bills, sales transactions, stock prices, or scientific constants — followed a very similar distribution of leading digits:\n1 ≈ 30.1% 2 ≈ 17.6% 3 ≈ 12.5% … and so on … 9 ≈ 4.6% This is Benford\u0026rsquo;s Law.\nWhy Does This Happen? # Benford\u0026rsquo;s Law emerges in datasets that:\nSpan multiple orders of magnitude Grow naturally over time Are not artificially bounded Are not human-generated round numbers Think of real-world quantities: population sizes, financial transaction amounts, file sizes, physical measurements.\nThese values tend to grow multiplicatively, and their distribution naturally shifts toward lower leading digits.\nThe result?\nA remarkably stable pattern that repeats across domains, countries, and time periods.\nWhy Benford\u0026rsquo;s Law Is a Weapon Against Fraud # Humans are predictable in their unpredictability.\nWhen people try to manipulate data — alter invoices, fake expense reports, fabricate numbers — they don\u0026rsquo;t reproduce Benford\u0026rsquo;s Law. They tend to create distributions that look too uniform, or make certain digits appear more than they naturally should.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where Benford\u0026rsquo;s Law becomes a red flag detector.\nIt helps uncover:\n✔ Accounting anomalies\nFraudulent journals, inflated revenues, round-number biases. ✔ Data tampering\nManually edited logs, altered survey responses. ✔ Financial fraud\nExpense claims, reimbursement padding. ✔ Large-scale input errors\nMistyped values, systematic mistakes, corrupted imports. If the dataset\u0026rsquo;s leading-digit distribution deviates significantly from Benford\u0026rsquo;s expected curve… something is almost certainly wrong.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t prove intent, but it highlights exactly where to look.\nHow Analysts Can Use Benford\u0026rsquo;s Law # Benford\u0026rsquo;s Law is incredibly easy to test.\nMost BI or analytics tools can compute leading-digit frequencies in seconds. You can apply it to:\nInvoice databases Sales transactions Operational logs The process is straightforward:\nExtract the leading digit from each numerical value Compute the distribution Compare against Benford\u0026rsquo;s expected distribution Investigate the deviations Even small mismatches can reveal major insights.\nWhy Don\u0026rsquo;t More Analysts Use It? # Despite its power, Benford\u0026rsquo;s Law is often overlooked because:\nMany analysts simply aren\u0026rsquo;t aware of it It seems \u0026ldquo;too simple\u0026rdquo; to matter Its counterintuitive nature leads to skepticism It\u0026rsquo;s rarely taught in standard analytics or accounting curricula Teams rely heavily on machine learning instead of statistical fundamentals But simplicity is exactly what makes it valuable.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fast.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t require modeling assumptions.\nAnd it works unbelievably well for certain types of datasets.\nA Simple Tool, Massive Impact # In a world where data systems are more complex than ever, sometimes the most elegant solutions come from fundamental mathematics.\nBenford\u0026rsquo;s Law won\u0026rsquo;t replace AI fraud detection models.\nBut it will catch anomalies long before most analysts ever think to look.\nSo the next time you\u0026rsquo;re handed a messy dataset or financial ledger and something feels off, try the simplest test in the book:\nCheck the first digits.\nThe numbers might be trying to tell you something.\n","date":"December 13, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/loid-de-benford/","section":"Blog","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen we talk about data fraud detection, most people think of complex models, AI pipelines, or forensic accounting teams armed with custom algorithms.\u003cbr\u003e\nBut sometimes, one of the most powerful tools is also one of the simplest.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Benford's Law: The Anti-Fraud Tool Most Analysts Never Use","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"December 13, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/data-analysis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Data Analysis","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"December 13, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/data-quality/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Data Quality","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"December 13, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/finance/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Finance","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"December 13, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/fraud-detection/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fraud Detection","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"December 13, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/statistics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Statistics","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/fr/tags/analyse/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Analyse","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"December 1, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/analysis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Analysis","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"December 1, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/data/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Data","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"December 1, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/paradox/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Paradox","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/fr/tags/paradoxe/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Paradoxe","type":"tags"},{"content":" Simpson’s paradox is one of the most puzzling phenomena in statistics. It occurs when a trend observed in several distinct groups completely reverses once those groups are combined. In other words, what appears true within each subgroup can become false when the data is analyzed as a whole.\nThis phenomenon has major implications in medicine, economics, marketing, and the social sciences. Understanding it is essential to avoid incorrect conclusions when analyzing heterogeneous data.\n1. A Simple Medical Example # Imagine a clinical trial involving 160 patients (80 women and 80 men). These patients receive either a drug or a placebo. Treatment effectiveness is measured by the recovery rate.\nResults Among Women # Women Recovered Not Recovered Total Recovery Rate Drug 4 16 20 20% Placebo 18 42 60 30% 👉 Among women, the placebo performs better (30% vs 20%).\nResults Among Men # Men Recovered Not Recovered Total Recovery Rate Drug 36 24 60 60% Placebo 14 6 20 70% 👉 Among men as well, the placebo is superior (70% vs 60%).\nWhen analyzing the two groups separately, the conclusion seems clear:\nthe placebo works better.\nOverall Results # Overall Recovered Not Recovered Total Recovery Rate Drug 40 40 80 50% Placebo 32 48 80 40% 👉 But when the two groups are combined, the drug becomes more effective (50% vs 40%).\nHow can a treatment perform worse in every group, yet better overall?\nThis is exactly what Simpson’s paradox reveals.\n2. Why Does the Conclusion Reverse? # The reversal is caused by a confounding variable — here, the sex of the patients.\nIn our study:\nThe drug was mainly given to men (who naturally recover more often: 60–70%), while the placebo was mainly given to women (who naturally recover less often: 20–30%).\nAs a result, the drug benefits from a favorable distribution, which artificially improves its overall performance.\nThis composition bias perfectly illustrates the mechanism behind Simpson’s paradox:\nA trend can reverse when the proportions of each group differ.\n3. Real-World Situations Where the Paradox Appears # Simpson’s paradox is not just a theoretical curiosity. It appears regularly in real-world data analyses.\nMedicine # A treatment may seem more or less effective depending on age, sex, or disease stage. Without proper stratification, conclusions can be misleading.\nMarketing Analytics # A lower overall conversion rate may hide better performance across individual channels (mobile, desktop, specific campaigns).\nHuman Resources # A department may show strong overall performance while each individual team performs worse when analyzed separately.\nThe Berkeley Case (1973) # The university appeared to discriminate against women in admissions. In reality, women applied more often to highly selective departments. Department by department, women were slightly favored.\n4. How to Avoid This Analytical Trap # To protect against incorrect conclusions, several best practices are essential:\n1. Identify Confounding Variables # Look for factors that influence both the cause and the outcome.\n2. Analyze Data by Subgroups # Global statistics are often just a summary — and sometimes a misleading one.\n3. Use Appropriate Statistical Tools # Multivariate regressions, adjusted models, or randomization help avoid the trap.\n4. Check Group Comparability # Always ask:\nAre the groups comparable? Could an unaccounted variable reverse the interpretation? 5. So Which Analysis Should Be Trusted? # In our example, the answer depends on the question being asked.\nTo Measure the Intrinsic Effectiveness of a Treatment: # ➡️ Analyze each group separately.\nHere, the placebo is more effective in every subgroup.\nTo Predict Outcomes in a Population with Similar Composition: # ➡️ Look at the aggregated data.\nHere, the drug performs better overall.\nIn clinical trials, the goal is usually to measure the true effectiveness of a treatment. That makes it crucial to control or balance confounding variables.\nConclusion # Simpson’s paradox reminds us that aggregated data can hide or even reverse real trends. Meaningful analysis requires understanding the context, identifying structural variables, and choosing the appropriate level of interpretation.\nKey Takeaways # Global averages can be misleading. Data must be analyzed at the correct scale. Confounding variables must be identified and controlled. A conclusion only makes sense within its analytical context. Before drawing conclusions from aggregated numbers, always ask:\n“Is there a hidden variable that could explain this trend?”\nThis simple precaution can prevent many interpretation errors — even among experienced analysts.\n","date":"December 1, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/simpson_paradox/","section":"Blog","summary":"\u003cimg src=\"feature.png\" alt=\"Simpson's Paradox illustration\" style=\"width: 70%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem auto;\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimpson’s paradox is one of the most puzzling phenomena in statistics.

RFM provides simple yet highly effective segmentation variables that can be applied to virtually any online store.\n👉 If you want to explore the full notebook and follow the analysis step by step, you can access it here..\n🧩 Why Segmenting Your Customers Really Matters # Every business knows customer behavior is far from uniform. Some shoppers return often, spend more, and stay loyal over time. Others buy occasionally or are at risk of disengaging entirely.\nA solid segmentation strategy helps businesses:\nIdentify high-value customers and strengthen their loyalty Detect inactive or at-risk customers and reconnect with them Personalize marketing campaigns to maximize ROI Allocate marketing resources more efficiently by focusing on the most profitable segments In short, segmentation allows companies to shift from generic marketing to precision-driven, high-impact strategies.\n🛠️ The Project: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights # To show exactly how transactional data can lead to strategic decisions, I created this project aimed at understanding customer behavior and extracting the most relevant insights.\n📊 RFM: A Simple Framework With Powerful Results # The RFM method is built around three key metrics from a customer\u0026rsquo;s purchase history:\nRecency — How long it has been since their last purchase Frequency — How often they purchase Monetary — How much money they have spent These three dimensions create a clear picture of each customer\u0026rsquo;s behavior and form the foundation for actionable segmentation.\n🚀 What Businesses Can Gain From RFM Segmentation # With a segmentation project like this, companies can:\nStrengthen loyalty among their best customers\nReward high-value customers with tailored offers, early access, or premium programs.\nReactivate customers who have gone quiet\nIdentify at-risk customers and re-engage them with targeted campaigns or incentives.\nIncrease average customer value\nSpot opportunities for upselling and cross-selling based on customer engagement.\nOptimize marketing performance\nAllocate resources to the most profitable customer segments for maximum ROI.\nImprove strategic decision-making\nUse behavioral insights to guide long-term commercial and marketing strategies.\n🔍 Results: Four Actionable Customer Segments # By the end of the analysis, I identified four clear customer clusters, each with its own marketing approach.\n1. Retain — High Value, High Frequency # These loyal customers purchase regularly, even if not always recently.\nAction: Strengthen loyalty programs, deliver personalized offers, and maintain consistent engagement.\n2. Re-engage — Low Value, Inactive # Customers who buy rarely and haven\u0026rsquo;t purchased in a long time.\nAction: Targeted reactivation campaigns, reminders, and promotional nudges.\n3. Develop — New or Low Value but Recent # Low-frequency buyers who have purchased recently — often new customers.\nAction: Build the relationship, offer exceptional support, and encourage repeat purchases.\n4. Reward — The Super Loyal, High-Spending Customers # The best customers: frequent, active, and high-value.\nAction: Exclusive perks, strong loyalty rewards, and active recognition of their commitment.\n🎯 Conclusion: Turning Data Into Competitive Advantage # This project highlights how a simple yet robust segmentation approach can turn raw data into meaningful marketing actions — improving retention, boosting performance, and increasing profitability.\nIn a world where customers expect personalized experiences, companies that understand and anticipate buying behavior gain a major competitive edge.\n","date":"November 24, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/segmentation-clients/","section":"Blog","summary":"\u003cimg src=\"feature.png\" alt=\"Customer segmentation through clustering\" style=\"width: 50%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto 2rem auto;\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn today\u0026rsquo;s hyper-competitive e-commerce landscape — where buying behaviors evolve faster than ever — businesses need a deep understanding of their customers to make smarter strategic decisions.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Customer Segmentation: Transforming Data into Marketing Decisions","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"November 24, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/marketing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Marketing","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"November 24, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/rfm/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"RFM","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"November 24, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/segmentation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Segmentation","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
